## No-Issues {Grievance Redressal System}

Admin can always receive verbal complaints but such complaints can be forgotten so anyone who wishes to lodge a complaint in a college is required to do so in writing and then must wait for a response from the person to whom the letter is directed. Dealing with too many complaints without delay can be a challenging task. Therefore we have made our project in a way that complaints can be effortlessly managed and make the process a whole lot easier.
<br />
<br />
Students have the ability to register for an account on this website and then sign in using that account in order to submit complaints on the many type of problems they stumble upon.
<br />
The administrator needs to log in using his login id to view the complaints that have been submitted by the students and has the opportunity to read all of the specifics of the complaint and take any further actions that may be required as a result of what they discover.
<br />
There will be a hard and fast deadline attached to the resolution of each complaint.Â After the allotted amount of time has passed, the complaint is escalated to the higher authority; if, in addition, the higher authority does not act upon the complaint, then the complaint itself is escalated to the higher authority of the higher authority that initially received it. 
<br />
The complaints that are filed may now be tracked more easily as a result of this change. In order to record the authority in a hierarchical fashion, we have chosen to use a tree data structure.
